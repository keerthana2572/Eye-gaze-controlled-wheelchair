# Eye-gaze-controlled-wheelchair

The IOT based Eye Gaze controlled wheelchair is a solution to the individuals with physical disabilities.The project aims to enable an easier movement to them without requiring any assistance.
This technology utilizes webcam to track the position of the user's eyes, allowing for accurate detection of their gaze direction. The captured data is then transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the information and translates it into wheelchair movement commands.
The prototype is built using DC motors and a DC motor driver is used to coordinate the wheels.Power supply is provided through batteries.
Addtionally, the prototype is also configured with Bluetooth.The model works even with the Bluetooth control through the Bluetooth module connected to the Arduino UNO.
The code to pinout is written in Arduino IDE.
